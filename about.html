			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>My name is Asher Vahalik. I have three primary interests:</p>
			<p><b>Music.</b> I have studied piano for around 8 years, and organ for around 1 year. I have a number of musical accomplishments under my belt, such as being a semifinalist in the TMTA Performance Contest for piano, performing for 3 years in the TMTA All Star Festival, and 4 years for the CTMTA Piano Ensemble. I have been to the Baylor Summer Organ Camp once. I'm also starting to dabble in playing organ for church services. I have also done a handful of organ repairs, being technically minded.</p>
			<p><b>Programming.</b> As you may have noticed, I have an interest in programming. I wrote this entire website and created two GitHub repos by hand. I create a number of side projects for my personal use all the time. I'm somewhat familiar with a number of programming languages, with my #1 favorite being Python.</p>
			<p><b>Minecraft.</b> I would have put gaming in general, but I particularly enjoy playing Minecraft, and it's the one I play most. <i>(I say that, but it's worth noting that I have put 500+ hours into Breath of the Wild.)</i> I am a member of (and regular player on) KingdomCraft, the world's largest Christian minecraft server.</p>
